Setting up the develpment database
-------------------------------------

In order to manually test the product, and to run the automated tests, a database user must be created with certain privileges. For MySQL, this is a sample setting that works::

    luciano@ersatz:~$ sudo mysql -p
    Enter password: 
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 34
    Server version: 5.0.75-0ubuntu10.2 (Ubuntu)

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

    mysql> create database clinicaltrials;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> create user 'tester'@'localhost' identified by 'puffpuff';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> grant all privileges on clinicaltrials.* to 'tester'@'localhost';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
