Typically, PCI is performed by threading a slender balloon-tipped tube, a catheter, from an artery in the groin to a trouble spot in an artery of the heart. The balloon is then inflated, compressing the plaque and dilating (widening) the narrowed coronary artery so that blood can flow more easily. During PCI for this study, the BVS EECSS is then placed in the coronary artery to support the previously narrowed area. The BVS EECSS will remain in place until the bioabsorbtion process is complete, your physician will discuss this process with you.
